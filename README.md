# Chrome App-Bound Encryption Decryption

## Overview

This tool decrypts **App-Bound Encrypted (ABE)** keys stored in the Local State file of supported Chromium-based browsers, including **Google Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge**. ABE, introduced in Chrome version 127, binds decryption capabilities to specific applications to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data such as cookies (and potentially passwords and payment information in the future). This tool leverages the internal COM-based **IElevator** service, unique to each browser, to retrieve and decrypt these keys.

## Supported and tested Browsers

- Google Chrome (130.0.6723.91)
- Brave (1.71.118)
- Microsoft Edge (130.0.2849.56)

> [!NOTE]  
> This tool should be run from within each browser's application directory due to the path validation constraints of ABE.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Build Tools**: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ or compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC `cl` command)
- **Libraries**: Requires the following libraries: `ole32.lib`, `oleaut32.lib`, `shell32.lib`, `version.lib`, and `comsuppw.lib`.

## Usage

Build using your preferred C++ compiler:

```bash
cl /EHsc chrome_decrypt.cpp oleaut32.lib shell32.lib advapi32.lib shlwapi.lib
```

Place the compiled executable within the Chrome application directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application) due to path validation constraints inherent in Chromeâ€™s ABE.
Run the executable from the command line:

```bash
PS C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application> .\chrome_decrypt.exe chrome
PS C:\Program Files\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application> .\chrome_decrypt.exe brave
PS C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application> .\chrome_decrypt.exe edge
```

### Example

```bash
PS C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application> .\chrome_decrypt.exe chrome
